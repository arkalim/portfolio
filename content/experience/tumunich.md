## Description
**Guide:** **Mohammad Farid Azampour** (Visiting Researcher at Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, TU Munich)

- Rearchitected Pix2Pix, a CGAN architecture, to generate Ultrasound (US) scans from MRI scans
- Addressed the challenge of structural dissimilarity between MRI and US scans due to data collection methods
- Developed a custom loss function combining CGAN loss and Dice Loss for improved image segmentation
- Implemented the loss function to encourage the generator to eliminate structural deformation in the generated US scans
- Leveraged remote access to TU-Munich's cluster computers for fast model training
- Utilized TU-Munich's Discourse forum for collaboration which drove the project to fruition
