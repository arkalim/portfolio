### Description:
I worked as a machine learning intern at [**OriginHealth Pte. Ltd.**](https://www.originhealth.ai/) (Singapore), where the company envisions to automate the detection of **birth defects** from **fetal ultrasound scans**, a procedure that demands expertise in **radiology**. Here, I developed a custom deep learning framework using **PyTorch** as the backend and used it to train neural networks for a range of subtasks, including **Fetal-Tissue Segmentation** and **Optimal Plane Detection** for ultrasound scans. My contributions served as a sound foundation for the company’s automation motive. This opportunity provided me with a deeper insight into the applications of AI and Computer Vision in medical diagnosis and taught me to work with little and sensitive data. In addition, **Confluence** was used for documentation and **Jira Software** was used for **Agile Software Development**.
