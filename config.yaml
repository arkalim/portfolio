    title: "Abdur Rahman"
    subtitle: As a Senior Software Engineer diving deep into the realms of cloud infrastructure and AI at [**16Bit.ai**](https://www.16bit.ai), I've been stirring up some serious cloud-native concoctions, slicing AWS costs in half (like a budget ninja!), and automating the heck out of everything from ML pipelines to testing — because, let's face it, who has the time? My adventures have taken me from crafting serverless marvels to teaching computers how to understand X-Ray images. Alongside juggling bits and bytes, I've championed customer success and danced through the technical challenges with a bit of flair and a lot of code. I'm all about making tech less intimidating and more fun, one Kubernetes cluster at a time.
